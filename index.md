## About me

I'm currently working within Svetha Venkatesh's Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics group at Deakin University, Australia. As part of this larger research group I am focused on facilitating considered implementation of machine-learning methods on high-throughput biological data; in particular transcriptomics of complex diseases. 

As a very early career researcher I'm currently working on improving my independent research skills and finding areas of computational biology that hold interest to me for future research directions. 

When not focusing on my research I'll be found exploring and climbing in the Grampians / Gariwerd National Park.
