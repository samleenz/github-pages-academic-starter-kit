## About me

I'm currently working within Svetha Venkatesh's Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics group at Deakin University, Australia. As part of this larger research group my role is to facilitate the overall research efforts of the Health Group into high-throughput biological data while persuing my own independent research interests.

As a very early career researcher I'm currently working on improving my independent research skills and finding areas of computational biology that hold interest to me for future research directions. 

General areas of interest for me include:

* Complex disease transcriptomics
* Alternative splicing in humans
* Unsupervised ML methods, with particular application to variable clustering
* Biologically motivated design of ML pipelines
* Data integration

When not focusing on my research I'll be found exploring and climbing in the Grampians / Gariwerd National Park.
