## About

I'm a resarch assistant in the Structural Bioinformatics and Drug Design group at St Vincent's Institute in Melbourne. Within this group I'm currently contributing to both computational drug-discovery projects for rare cancers and cell culture studies investigating haemopoetic stem cell regulation with the Stem Cell Regulation Unit.
<!-- As a very early career researcher I'm currently working on improving my independent research skills and finding areas of computational biology that hold interest to me for future research directions.  -->

Whilst my research methodology has a computational focus I view myself first as a biologist. The questions I seek to answer and the approachs I take are informed by my views of biology as a complex system operating under multiple hierachies. 


Current areas of research interest, in no real order, include:

* Network science and its applications for biological data
* Complex disease transcriptomics
* Cancer transcriptomics 
* Neurospsychiatric disorders and their shared etiology
<!-- When not focusing on my research I'll be found exploring and climbing in the Grampians / Gariwerd National Park. -->
